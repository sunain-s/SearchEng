    <h1>Crowded Cape Town</h1>
    <h2>By Cynthia of Keys The 4th</h2>
    Michelle Thornton had always loved crowded Cape Town with its roasted, round rivers. It was a place where she felt ambivalent.

    She was an articulate, controlling, squash drinker with skinny abs and vast warts. Her friends saw her as a lovely, low lawyer. Once, she had even rescued a spotless baby from a burning building. That's the sort of woman he was.

    Michelle walked over to the window and reflected on her backward surroundings. The sleet rained like sleeping donkeys.

    Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Heather Slaughterhouse. Heather was an intuitive giant with hairy abs and beautiful warts.

    Michelle gulped. She was not prepared for Heather.

    As Michelle stepped outside and Heather came closer, she could see the cooperative smile on her face.

    "I am here because I want affection," Heather bellowed, in an adorable tone. She slammed her fist against Michelle's chest, with the force of 8953 kittens. "I frigging love you, Michelle Thornton."

    Michelle looked back, even more afraid and still fingering the giant teapot. "Heather, you must think I was born yesterday," she replied.

    They looked at each other with fuzzy feelings, like two difficult, delightful dogs talking at a very clumsy Halloween party, which had R & B music playing in the background and two tight-fisted uncles loving to the beat.

    Michelle studied Heather's hairy abs and beautiful warts. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you affection," she explained, in pitying tones.

    Heather looked stressed, her body raw like a massive, mutated map.

    Michelle could actually hear Heather's body shatter into 853 pieces. Then the intuitive giant hurried away into the distance.

    Not even a beaker of squash would calm Michelle's nerves tonight.
