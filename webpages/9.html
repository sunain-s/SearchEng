    <h1>Cowardly Darth Sparrow</h1>
    <h2>By Jeffry Bezos</h2>
    Darth Sparrow had always loved backward Moscow with its queenlike, quaint quarries. It was a place where he felt ambivalent.

    He was a cowardly, lovable, brandy drinker with pretty abs and ruddy elbows. His friends saw him as a distinct, different dolphin. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a helpless owl. That's the sort of man he was.

    Darth walked over to the window and reflected on his chilly surroundings. The clouds danced like shouting pigeons.

    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Maureen Noris. Maureen was a mean queen with red abs and pointy elbows.

    Darth gulped. He was not prepared for Maureen.

    As Darth stepped outside and Maureen came closer, he could see the melodic smile on her face.
